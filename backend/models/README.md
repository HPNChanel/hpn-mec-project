# Database Models

This directory contains SQLAlchemy ORM models that represent database tables for the HPN MEC Medical Health System.

## Models

- **user.py**: User account information
- **patient.py**: Patient-specific data
- **health_record.py**: Medical records and health information
- **appointment.py**: Appointment scheduling
- **admin.py**: Administrative user data

Each model should:
1. Define table schema
2. Set up appropriate relationships
3. Include relevant constraints
4. Define properties and methods as needed

These models are used by SQLAlchemy to interact with the database and represent the application's data structure.
